# IBM Security Verify Access AAC Java Mehanism

## Java Mechanism
The source code and associated build files for the custom java mechanism.

To build this mechanism two jars are required. One is the AAC mechanism extension, which is downloaded from an IBM
Security Verify Access appliance; the second is an implementation of the javax.json interfaces. I used the Wepshpere JSON-P
jar but any implementation of the javax.json interface should work.
